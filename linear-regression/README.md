This folder contains practice on Linear Regression models, both the one using the Normal Equation
and another using gradient descent. The normal equation model does not use cross-validation.

ALSO:
I chose to practice using Jupyter Notebook, so that's why one is using that and one is a normal Python file.

Project:
The SGD multi-feature regression model is found in [ecommerce.py].
